# Energy Theft Detection Using Hybrid CNN-MLP Model

This repository contains the code and resources for the project **"Energy Theft Detection Using Hybrid CNN-MLP Model"**. The project is focused on detecting electricity theft by analyzing energy consumption data using a hybrid machine learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The emphasis is on improving the precision of theft detection, reducing false positives, and enhancing the overall reliability of the model.

## Project Overview

Electricity theft is a significant issue that leads to substantial revenue losses for power grid operators. Traditional methods of detecting electricity theft are often manual, time-consuming, and less effective. This project proposes a novel approach that leverages a hybrid deep learning model to automatically identify fraudulent behavior by analyzing historical consumption patterns.

### Key Features

- **Hybrid Model Architecture**: Combines the strengths of CNN and MLP to capture both local and global patterns in time-series data.
- **Data Inputs**: The model processes daily and weekly aggregated electricity consumption data to enhance the detection of anomalies.
- **Focus on Precision**: Special attention is given to maximizing the precision of the model to minimize false positives in identifying electricity theft.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC).
